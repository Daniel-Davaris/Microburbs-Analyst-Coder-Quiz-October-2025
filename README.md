💎 INVESTMENT SWEET SPOTS:
   • No properties currently meet all sweet spot criteria
   • Consider relaxing some criteria for more options

📊 KEY INSIGHTS FROM ENHANCED ANALYSIS:
   1. Properties closer to CBD generally show higher investment scores
   2. Premium materials (Stone, Double Brick) correlate with higher property values
   3. Inner suburbs (15-30km) often provide best balance of accessibility and value
   4. Brick veneer properties offer good value-to-quality ratio
   5. Enhanced scoring helps identify properties with location AND quality advantages
